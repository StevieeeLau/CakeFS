CakeFS: Hiding Under Layers of Fluff 

Project Overview:

The purpose of CakeFS is to demonstrate a basic anti-forensic tool by creating a hidden file system that operates entirely in user space. This approach allows data to remain undetected by traditional forensic tools that scan kernel-managed partitions and file systems. CakeFS achieves this by mounting a file system that can only be accessed when booted into a controlled environment and activated via a user-level command.
